# GenProt

The framework uses deep generative architectures and evolutionary algorithms to optimize novel proteins against specific design objectives. 

## Case study
 The generative model is trained with Coronavirus-Binding Antibody Sequences, heavy and light chain sequences, retrieved from the [CoV-AbDab](https://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/covabdab/).
