Framework implementing deep learning generative models for novel enzyme design

# Deep learning generative models for novel enzyme design.

The objective of this work was to develop a platform to generate new protein sequences, using different deep learning architectures and use evolutionary computation to steer the generative process towards specific optimization objectives. 

VAE - deep-protein-generation (https://github.com/alex-hh/

To run each architecture throughout all the experiments, two conda environment must be created (one for each deep learning architecture)
conda env create --file environment_vae.yml
